- NEW:
    - Added all the pill effects (too lazy to list them off)
- CHANGES:
    - Made Mom's Knife stuff work with Atlas' Salt auto-fire
    - Lion Skull's effect now triggers on Greed wave clear as well.
    - Fixed Mom's Knife and tech/brim lasers not dealing extra damage when Obsidian Chunk's effect procs.
    - Fixed EID conditional descriptions not appearing.
    - Made some balance changes to Jonas:
        - Pill pool is unidentified each floor.
        - Pill bonuses are given on every pill use but are smaller and give diminishing returns
        - Reduced pill bonus reset to 4 rooms (5 waves in greed)
        - You keep 1/3rd of your pill bonuses at the start of a new floor instead of losing them all.
